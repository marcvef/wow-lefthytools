# Questtree

Quest chains for every zone of WoW: Forever: what a quest needs first, what it leads to, who gives
and takes it and where, and where each quest stands for you and your friends.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `Modules/Questtree/Data.lua` | the quest data (`LefthyTools_QuestData`): loading it, the accessors, search, learned data |
| `Modules/Questtree/Engine.lua` | a quest's status for me or a friend, what's missing, what it opens, its chain, what's next |
| `LefthyTools_QuestData/` | the data, an add-on of its own (load on demand, GPL v3) |
| `tools/update-quest-data.js` | makes the data |

Every Questtree file starts with `local Q = ns.Questtree or {}; ns.Questtree = Q`, so the order they
load in doesn't matter for the table.

## Data

### Where it comes from

`LefthyTools_QuestData/QuestData.lua` is made by `node tools/update-quest-data.js [build] [--cache
<dir>] [--dump <file>] [--eglink <commit>] [--stats]` (the same output for the same inputs):

- **Classic quests: CMaNGOS Classic DB** (Full_DB z2815, GPL v3, the dump the Bestiary's drop data
  comes from): `quest_template`, `creature_`/`gameobject_questrelation` (givers),
  `..._involvedrelation` (enders), `item_template.startquest`, the spawns (`creature`,
  `creature_spawn_entry`, `gameobject`) and the templates' names and factions.
- **Forever's new quests: EG Link** (`github.com/JIVESCORP/eg-link-output-wowf`, CC BY 4.0: "Data
  from Efficient Games (https://efficient.games), licensed under CC BY 4.0"): `quests.enUS`
  (title, levels, race mask, zone, `nextQuestId`, `startItemId`), `npcs` (who offers and takes each
  quest, their uiMap positions, their side) and `quest_prerequisites` (what every character seen
  taking a quest had done before: `before`, `characters`). The commit used is in `source`.
- **Forever's client tables** (wago.tools): UiMap, UiMapAssignment, AreaTable, Map, QuestSort,
  FactionTemplate, QuestV2, QuestLineXQuest, ItemSparse (StartQuestID, item names), QuestPOIBlob.
- `Data/ForeverQuests.lua`: which quests are new in Forever (the `new` flag).

Not used: Wowhead and anything taken from Questie (the project's rule), and ForeverCore's sniffs
(advocaite/Karrz1 TrinityCore `forever`: GPL-2.0 without "or later", which can't go into a GPL v3
file, and it credits Questie for quest data).

### The rules

- **Previous quests** (as MaNGOS' core checks them): a quest's `PrevQuestId` and every quest whose
  `NextQuestId` names it. Positive: completed first; any one of them is enough (`preAny`), except
  one in an `ExclusiveGroup` below 0, whose whole group is needed (`pre`); one alone is `pre`.
  Negative: in the quest log (`preActive`).
- `ExclusiveGroup` above 0: the group's quests close each other (`excl`).
- `NextQuestInChain` (the ender offers the next) and `BreadcrumbForQuestId` lead on without being
  needed: only in `opens`. `opens` is the reverse of everything a quest needs, plus those.
- **Forever's quests:** EG Link's `nextQuestId` leads on (`opens`) and is needed by the next one
  unless that one's `before` record (two characters or more) lacks it, or classic-db already says
  what it needs (classic's data checks 87% of `NextQuestInChain` links that way). Forever's quest
  lines (QuestLineXQuest, by `OrderIndex`) give the same where nothing else does. Last, a quest
  with nothing else whose `before` (three characters or more) has exactly one new quest of the same
  zone that isn't before another of them: that one.
- **Zones:** `ZoneOrSort` above 0 is an area: a dungeon, raid or battleground (the instance's own
  area, `Map.AreaTableID`, or an area on an instance map) gives `dungeon`; otherwise the area's
  uiMap (UiMapAssignment by area, else its parent areas'). Below 0 it's a QuestSort (class,
  profession, Seasonal, Camping, ...): `sort`, and the zone is the first giver's. Forever's quests:
  EG Link's area or category, QuestPOIBlob's map, the giver's zone.
- **Places:** each spawn's world x/y on the smallest zone (or dungeon floor, by height) rectangle of
  UiMapAssignment holding it: `mapX = (maxY - y) / (maxY - minY)`, `mapY = (maxX - x) / (maxX -
  minX)`, then into the assignment's `UiMin`..`UiMax` (Marshal Dughan comes out at 42.1, 65.9, as in
  game). Rectangles of neighbouring zones overlap at the borders: the zone of the NPC's own quests
  wins there and the others are stored as alternatives (a zone at most 4 times the other's size; a
  city and the zone around it never: a city's spawn stays in the city). Data.lua asks the client
  (`C_Map.GetMapInfoAtPosition` on the continent) which one it is when it reads the NPC, and keeps
  the guess if the answer is none of them. Up to 5 places per NPC, 1% apart. No spawn: EG Link's
  positions; none at all: no points (event NPCs).
- **Faction:** races only of one side; else, without races, when every NPC giver is on one side
  (FactionTemplate's groups, EG Link's `side`). Races and classes are classic's bit masks (race ID
  r is bit r, Human 1 ... Troll 8; class Warrior 1, ..., Druid 11); EG Link's 64-bit race mask: its
  low 8 bits.
- **Left out:** classic quests the Forever client doesn't have (not in QuestV2, unless repeatable;
  137, mostly Naxxramas' tier quests), unused ones by title, quests nobody gives or takes; Forever's
  test quests; later classic content (IDs 10000+) no one was seen offered.

Numbers (Forever 1.60.1.70862, EG Link 9fcae73): 5257 quests (4031 classic, 1226 Forever's), 3473
of them in 784 chains, 4312 with a giver on the map or an item; of the 1817 new quests 1213 are in
it, 415 with chain info, 492 with a giver, 808 with a zone; 50 zones, 35 dungeons, 1667 NPCs, 239
objects, 599 items; 0.53 MB.

### Format

```
LefthyToolsQuestData = {
  source, build,
  names = { "Ahn'Qiraj Temple", ... },              -- zoneName, sort and dungeon are indexes into it
  zones = { [uiMap] = "continent|minLevel|maxLevel|name|quest IDs" },
  dungeons = { [names index] = "minLevel|maxLevel|quest IDs" },
  npcs = { [id] = "name|map,x,y;map,x,y/map,x,y" }, objects = (the same), items = { [id] = "name" },
  quests = { [id] = "title|level|minLevel|races|classes|zone|zoneName|sort|dungeon|pre|preAny|
                     preActive|excl|opens|breadcrumbFor|flags|skill|rep|starts|ends" },
}
```

x, y in thousandths; `/` separates a place's alternatives; quest IDs with `,`; flags: `A`/`H`
faction, `r` repeatable, `n` new in Forever, `f` from Forever's data; skill `line:value`, rep
`faction:min`; starts and ends `n<NPC>`, `o<object>`, `i<item>`. A zone's quests are in level order;
a zone's levels are its own quests' (not class or profession quests) without the lowest and highest
tenth (a city's level-60 quests). Strings, so loading is quick and only the quests asked for are
read.

### Loading and the accessors (`Q.*`)

- `Q.Load()`: loads `LefthyTools_QuestData` with `C_AddOns.LoadAddOn` the first time a window asks
  (never at login); true when the data is there. Asked once; if someone loads the add-on later it's
  taken. `Q.HasData()`: loaded, or installed and loadable (`C_AddOns.GetAddOnInfo`), without loading.
  `Q.DataProblem()`: why not (`MISSING`, `DISABLED`, ...). `Q.DataInfo()`: `{ source, build, quests }`.
- `Q.Quest(id)`: the quest table, read from its string the first time and kept (shared: callers
  never write into it):
  `{ id, title, level, minLevel, races, classes, faction, zone, zoneName, sort, dungeon, skill = { id,
  value }, rep = { faction, min }, pre, preAny, preActive, excl, opens, breadcrumbFor, repeatable,
  starts, ends, source = "classic"|"forever"|"learned", new }`. The lists are always tables (maybe
  empty). `starts`/`ends`: `{ kind = "npc"|"object"|"item", id, name, points = { { map, x, y } } }`,
  one table per NPC shared by all its quests. `zoneName`: the area's name, else the zone's, the
  dungeon's or the sort's. The title is English: the UI prefers `C_QuestLog.GetTitleForQuestID`.
- `Q.Zones()`: `{ map, name, continent, minLevel, maxLevel, count }` by continent, then level.
  `Q.Dungeons()`: `{ name, minLevel, maxLevel, count }` by level. `Q.ZoneQuests(map)`,
  `Q.DungeonQuests(name)`: quest IDs, the lowest level first.
- `Q.Search(text)`: quest IDs whose title (English, or the client's when it knows the quest) or
  giver's or ender's name contains the text, any case; title matches first, then by level. The
  index is made by the first search after a change (all quests' titles and people, one
  `GetTitleForQuestID` each).
- `Q.AddLearned(id, fields)`: learned data fills gaps and never replaces the data: values only
  where the quest has none; lists of quests (`pre`, `preAny`, `excl`, `opens`) only for quests not
  from classic-db (its lists, empty ones too, are what the core checks), and what a quest needs then
  leads to it (`opens` of the other); givers and enders: places for a known one without any, new
  ones only where classic-db has none or the quest isn't classic's. An unknown ID becomes a quest
  with `source = "learned"`, listed in its zone. Before the data is loaded the calls wait and are
  applied when it loads. `Q.OnDataChanged(fn)`: called once on the next frame after changes.
- `Q.dataGen` goes up with every change (the engine's caches read it).
- **Test hook** `Q.SetTestData(quests, zones)`: replaces the data with quest tables (a list, or by
  ID; `source` defaults to `"classic"`) and zones (`{ { map, name, continent [, minLevel, maxLevel]
  } }`; levels and counts from the quests when not given; dungeons from the quests' `dungeon`). What
  a quest needs leads to it (`opens`) without saying so. Learned data and caches go; the callbacks
  run at once.

## Engine

- **My progress:** completed quests from `C_QuestLog.GetAllCompletedQuestIDs`, read once and kept
  until the next loading screen (`PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, `PLAYER_LOGIN`); a quest turned in
  (`QUEST_TURNED_IN`) is added at once and kept until then, as the server's list may not have it
  yet. The quest log (`C_QuestLog.GetInfo`) is read again after `QUEST_ACCEPTED`/`REMOVED`/
  `LOG_UPDATE`. The events are registered with the first question (nothing runs before a window
  opens), and the handlers only note what changed. `Q.progressGen` goes up with a change of
  progress, level, skill or reputation.
- `Q.Status(id, who)` → `"done"` (completed), `"active"` (in the log), `"other"` (not for this
  character: race, class, faction, profession skill, reputation; or closed by another: an exclusive
  one done or taken, or the quest a breadcrumb leads to done or taken), `"locked"` (something it
  needs isn't done: all of `pre`, one of `preAny`, `preActive` in the log), `"level"` (below its
  `minLevel`), `"available"`; nil for a quest the data doesn't know. Mine are kept per data and
  progress change. What isn't known (no race, a reputation the client doesn't answer) counts as
  met. A friend's progress table (`who`): `{ done = { [id] = true }, active = { [id] = true }, level,
  faction, race (raceID) or raceFile, class (classID) or classFile }`; skill and reputation aren't
  checked for friends.
- `Q.Missing(id, who)` → `{ { id, status, reason } }`: what's missing, walked back through the chain
  across zones, the first one to do first. `reason`: `"done"` (must be completed), `"any"` (one of
  several: the best one, in the log, then available, then for me, the lowest level), `"log"` (must
  be in the quest log).
- `Q.Opens(id)`: what it leads to. `Q.Chain(id)`: every quest connected to it (needs, opens,
  exclusive ones, breadcrumbs; at most 400), each after what it needs, the lowest level first where
  there's a choice (a loop in the data: the lowest of the rest next); kept per data change, one list
  for all quests of a chain.
- `Q.Next()`: what the quests I finished or have in my log lead to that are `"available"` or
  `"locked"`: in my zone first (`C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit`, up to its zone), then by level, then the
  ones I can take. Kept until the data, progress, zone or level changes.
- `Q.Friends(id)`: `{ { name, classFile, status } }` by name for the friends in `Q.friends`
  (`{ [key] = progress table with name and classFile }`, kept by Learn.lua), `{}` without any.
  Learn.lua may define its own.

Not checked: `RequiredCondition` (classic's conditions table), `MaxLevel`, maximum reputation,
classic's seasonal events (Seasonal quests are listed but not marked as event-only).

### Open questions (in game)

- That `C_Map.GetMapInfoAtPosition` on a continent answers the zone at a border spot (Durotar or
  The Barrens), and `GetMapRectOnMap` gives the zone's rectangle there.
- That `C_QuestLog.GetAllCompletedQuestIDs` answers on Forever, and QUEST_TURNED_IN's quest ID.
- How long the first search takes (one `GetTitleForQuestID` per quest).
